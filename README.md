🌐Project Overview:

The project is a focused exploration of C programming and data structures, aiming to develop an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Monty ByteCodes is a scripting language compiled into Monty byte codes. The implementation involves incorporating various opcodes, including push, pall, pint, pop, swap, add, and nop. The project demands strict adherence to specific coding standards and requirements, ensuring a robust and efficient solution.

🐍 Monty Interpreter:

Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter! Crafted in the powerful C language, this interpreter is compliant with ISO90, ISO99, & ISO11 standards. It possesses the capability to read Monty bytecode files of any extension, with a preference for .m. The interpreter excels in interpreting the diverse set of opcodes contained within these files.

Monty Opcodes 🚀:

Push 📥:

Pushes an element onto the stack.
Usage: push <int>
Pall 👀:

Prints all values on the stack.
Usage: pall
Pint 🖨️:

Prints the value at the top of the stack.
Usage: pint
Pop 🔄:

Removes the top element of the stack.
Usage: pop
Swap ↔️:

Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
Usage: swap
Add ➕:

Adds the top two elements of the stack.
Usage: add
Nop 🚫:

No-operation, does nothing.
